        <p> 
        My name is John Galluzzo. I a student athlete at URI currently beginning my seventh semester at this wonderful school.
            I have a passion for all things that will make the body and mind stronger. The latest challenge presented to me is 
            the course CSC 106 - <em> The <strong> Joy </strong> of Programming </em> - taught by Professor Vic Fay-Wolfe
            and his wonderful teaching assistants. This web page represents the completion of my first assignment for this class,
            my first introduction to HTML and my first step toward conquering my newest challenge.
