          <h2> Welcome to John's Programming Portfolio </h2>
        
        <p> 
        My name is John Galluzzo. I a student athlete at URI currently beginning my seventh semester at this wonderful school.
            I have a passion for all things that will make the body and mind stronger. The latest challenge presented to me is 
            the course CSC 106 - <em> The <strong> Joy </strong> of Programming </em> - taught by Professor Vic Fay-Wolfe
            and his wonderful teaching assistants. With their help and the amazing resources provided by Khan Academy I have
            begun my journey to becoming an advanced programmer. My first taste of this new world of skills has started with
            the language HTML, with which this website has been created.
           
        </p>
      
        <p>
            This website has a multitude of uses. For me, it is excellent practice for learning a new passion. You however 
            may use it in various other ways. To find out more about me, click the <em> About Me </em> button above. To view 
            Javascript programs I have written, click the <em> Javascripts </em> button. Or, to accomplish almost nothing 
            click the <em> Apps </em> button, to view the utter lack of apps I have developed in my life. Enjoy!
