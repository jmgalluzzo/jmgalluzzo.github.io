                This page is dedicated to the game that I, along with my partner Matthew, created for our Final Project for
                CSC 106 at the University of Rhode Island. We call our game Dash's SuperSprint. The object of the game is to weave
                through the oncoming obstacles for as long as possible using the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard. 
                Be careful not to let them hit Dash! If he collides with too many he won't feel good enough to continue and you will 
                lose the game. However, if you can survive until the score reaches 250, you win! Please also feel free to explore 
                the How To Play page to read more about the rules and the About the Authors page to learn more about me and my 
                partner Matthew.
